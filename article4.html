<p style="color:#ff007f;" style="font-family:Helvetica;" align="left"><strong>What is Competitive Programming?</strong></p>

<p style="color:yellow;" align="center">In the Wiki-tongue:</p>
<p style="color:#554512;" align="left">Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers.</p>
<p style="color:yellow;" align="center">In the common tongue:</p>
<p style="color:#ff007f;" align="left">
In competitive programming, a user competes with others by solving a problem as quickly as he can.
But it is a common misconception that if you are not able solve the problem quickly, you are not good in it. It is completely wrong to think as such. Just read ahead to know why!<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="compro9.jpg" alt="Start now,It's never too late!" style="width:700px;height:360px;"></p>
<p align="left"><u><strong>What does competitive programming really do?</u></strong></p>
<p align="left">You may be thinking what is it in for me by just competing with others? That's a very wrong notion about Competitive programming that most of the people generally have. Competitive programming increases your problem solving ability, an important factor which later decides how good of an engineer you would become. You may learn a lot of languages..But unless you have that thinking in order to obtain a solution for a problem those skills are up for nothing! So in order to put your skills into best use, your problem solving skills should be of top notch. This is where Competitive Programming helps you. <br></p>

<p align="center"><img src="compro6.jpg" alt="Nothing matters in a competition except for winning!" style="width:700px;height:360px;"></p>
<p align="left"><u><strong>Getting Started with Competitive Programming....</u></strong></p>
<p align="left">
As a beginner you may find difficult to solve problems. But don't worry! Everyone faces this problem. The biggest mistake one would be doing at this point is thinking that Competitive programming is not my cup of tea and just not to try ahead. The key to really get a grip of this field is to keep on practising relentlessly. To solve a problem here is lot different from what you do in your university or college. You need to proceed according to what you are being asked to do. Before starting off with a solution, first carefully read the input the complier or IDE would be providing (the one where you will be writing all your code) and also the expected output. Always imagine how you would be solving the problem on paper and then proceed to put in the form of code..This surely does help a lot!  <br>

<p align="left"><strong>OK, I got it! But what are some good platforms for Competitive Programming?</strong></p>
<p align="left">There are many websites for Competitive Programming like CodeChef, Hackerrank, Codeforces, TopCoder,SPOJ(Sphere Online Judge) etc. But the one I would prefer as a beginner is <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a> as its user interface is very suitable for a beginner.<br>

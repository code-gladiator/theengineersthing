<div class="row text-center">
  <h4>THE QUESTION:Tell me about yourself.</h4>
  <p>
    Tell me about yourself! , This is the first question in any interview.The first question is really very important as it creates a base between the HR and the candidate, for all the questions to come,
so do not fumble.Telling about yourself can be in two different ways , If you are a fresher , you might start with with simple details like mentioning your name,the place you come from,Qualifications(in short) and your family(in short).
Now you might think that mentioning your family details would be unnecessary but if you skip this here, it will only come back to you again as another question.So give very brief details about your family members and how you are attached to them.On the other hand, if you are not a fresher and have worked in the industry atleast for 10-12 months,you could skip more 
of your personal details and concentrate more on how you have served the past company and what could make you the right choice for the new employer.Always remember not to address the interviewer as a sir/madam with every sentence you utter.Saying "that's all about me sir" at the end is perfectly okay.</p>

<div class="row text-center">
  <h4>THE QUESTION:Why do you want to join us?.</h4>
  <p>This question might seem easy, Wouldn't just reading some stuff from the company's 'about us' page, picking up a line or two from their mission and vision do fine? Honestly, No, That's not what they're looking for(atleast that's not going to make you any different from the others)
The interviewer would be more interested in knowing how you would feel being a member of the company and what you would suggest for its development.He/She will also look for leadership and management skills in your answer, for they don't just want a person who can do the assigned work,they want a person who could suggest better upgrades to the assigned work and also inspire his/her co-workers to do the same.</p>

<div class="row text-center">
  <h4>THE QUESTION:What are your strengths?</h4>
<p>
     This can be a difficult question for many ,as one needs to first identify them for himself.If you can't just get your positives to mind on your own,try a close friend or acquaintance to help you out.
However,each of your strengths should always be well enveloped with an example of a real-life situation you overcame with it's help.For example, It could be like "I discovered that my real strength was 'Fast Decision Making' when i handled .........".Such real life examples help the interviewer
understand that you are not just repeating a set of "Positive Qualities" from the web.Also try to explain how you could use your strengths to the advantage of the company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>


<div class="container">
<div class="row text-center">
  <h4>THE QUESTION:What are your weaknesses?</h4>
  <p>This question would really test your brain, Talking about strengths is fine, but who would talk about their weaknesses in open?.Believe it or not,
This is the quality companies look for the most, They want their employee to be honest of his/her shortcomings and work on it.So telling things like "My greatest weakness is that I am StraightForward" may not workout.
Try to tell the interviewer a real problem/weakness you have just discovered and how you are trying to overcome it.This will show him/her that you are always willing to work on your shortcomings.

  <h4>THE QUESTION:Why should I hire you?</h4>
  <p>
     Often carefully placed among other comfortable questions and posed suddenly,This question can be very intimidating.Answering this question in the right way would mostly get you the job.
But again it is not so easy,just like the first question "Tell me about yourself.", you will have to answer differently based on your experience.
A fresher with zero experience can brag about his Theoritical Knowledge and his certifications in Industry-oriented skills.But in the end ,it all comes to how he can convince the HR to give
him a chance.His/her best bet is to talk about how eager he/she is to start his/her career with the organisation and how he/she will strive to contribute to the progress of the company.<br>
On the other hand, An experienced candidate can directly state his/her ability to perform the role in the best way by supporting himself/herself with the previous experience constantly.Also a word or two
about commitment and hardwork would greatly help you land in your dream job/position.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="row text-center">
  <h4>THE QUESTION:How do you know about our company?</h4>
  <p>This is an easy question and it's your chance to elevate the organisation and the love/respect youv'e got for it.You could just
start with a great "Who wouldn't know the most famous .........in the ......... sector" or simply state that you were searching for job roles of the class and that you happened to come across the vacancy.If an aquaintance told you about the company or if you have any friends already working in the company, feel free to call/mention their names.
Also enquire about your friend's popularity in there, because you ultimately don't want to end up 'the Mr.LazyBug's friend'.Most of all ,Try to be cheerful and confident while answering a question.
That'll get you through many steps easily.

  <h4>THE QUESTION:Why are you looking for a new job?</h4>
  <p>
    If we were to make a list of the most dangerous questions asked in an interview(which is what we are making now),this would be the numero uno in it.Answer this well, and you are sure to get your job.The things that make this question so dangerous is the fact that it deals with the realtionship you had(or still having)with your old company,
your loyalty,your resposibility and your reasons to come out.Always start with a positive note and do not curse your old company(That would infact be the biggest mistake).Explain the right reasons and be frank!.Now ypou might ask "Wait, Be Frank?, You mean about the salary thing too?".An absolute Yes,
telling the interviewer honestly that you are moving out for a better pay for your skils isn't a very bad idea after all, but you should back it up with some solid achievements that make you special and worth more than what your present company is giving you.</p>

<div class="row text-center">
  <h4>THE QUESTION:How much are you expecting?</h4>
 <p>
    The answer to this question again depends if you are a fresher or an experienced candidate.
A fresher canot ask for a package, as it is not yet time to decide for himself how much his skills are worth in the market.A reply like "I really
don't care much about the package, The only thing that matters is gaining my very first career experience in such a great organisation."
On the other hand, an experienced candidate may demand a suitable package based on the skills he/she has. However, it is better to get to know 
personally from people who are working in the similar job role or get an estimate using sites like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm?countryRedirect=true">glassdoor</a></p>
